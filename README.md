## scgenokit: Single-Cell Genomic Data Analysis Toolkit

**scgenokit** is a Python-based toolkit designed to simplify and streamline the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It provides a collection of modular and user-friendly functions for performing key steps in the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline, including quality control, clustering, dimensionality reduction, differential expression analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis. The goal of this toolkit is to make single-cell data analysis more accessible and reproducible for both biologists and bioinformaticians.

Whether you're working with raw count data or pre-processed datasets, scgenokit helps you efficiently explore cellular heterogeneity and extract meaningful biological insights.

This project is developed by **Yuejun Xu** and **Jingyun Liu** as part of a data science software development course, with a focus on best practices including modular code design, version control, automated testing, and clear documentation.
